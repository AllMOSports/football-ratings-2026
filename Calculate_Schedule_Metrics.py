"""
calculate_schedule_metrics.py
 
Computes Strength of Schedule (SOS) and related opponent/game-log metrics
for a single football season, using:
  - football_ratings_{YEAR}.json  (per-team OVR ratings, produced by the
    ratings engine)
  - football_scoreboard_{YEAR}.csv (Date, Home Team, Home Score, Away Team,
    Away Score)
 
Writes a standalone schedule_metrics_{YEAR}.json file (does NOT modify the
ratings file) containing, per school:
  - sos                 avg OVR rating of every opponent faced (per game,
                         so a team played twice counts twice)
  - sos_rank             1 = toughest schedule in the season
  - sov                  Strength of Victory: avg OVR rating of teams beaten
  - wins / losses / ties
  - points_for / points_against / avg_margin
  - opponent_win_pct     alt/legacy SOS metric some sites show (opponents'
                          combined W-L% for the season, per game)
  - quality_wins         # of wins over teams ranked in the top
                          QUALITY_WIN_RANK_THRESHOLD by ovr_rank
  - home_record / away_record  {wins, losses, ties}
  - longest_win_streak
  - biggest_win          {opponent, margin, date}
  - closest_game         {opponent, margin, date, result}
  - game_log             chronological list of every game with opponent
                          rating/rank context

HOW TO REUSE THIS FOR EACH SEASON REPO (2026-2025):
Each season lives in its own repo, so this script is written to be copy/
pasted as-is into every season's repo. The ONLY thing you need to change
is SEASON_YEAR below. File names are derived from it automatically.
