build_football_schedule_2026.py
 
Converts football_games_2026_all.json (flat list of games, one row per
game with team1/team2/score1/score2) into football_schedule_2026.json
(per-team keyed format: {"teams": {schoolName: [game, ...]}}), matching
the same shape the Sport Detail snippet's SCHEDULE_URLS/HISTORICAL_SCHEDULE_URLS
already expect for every other sport/season.
 
Why this exists: football_games_2026_all.json comes from a different
pipeline/repo (AllMOSports/football-ratings-2026) than prior seasons'
schedule files (All_MO_Sports-Data/output/football_schedule_<year>.json),
and its schema is flat (team1/team2/score1/score2) rather than pre-split
per team with predicted scores. This script bridges that gap so the
existing front-end code needs zero changes.
 
No ratings-based fields (predicted_team_score, predicted_opp_score,
off_delta, def_delta, ovr_delta) are computed here -- they're left null
on every game, same as girls_volleyball's existing null-degradation
pattern, since football_ratings_2026.json won't exist until after Week 3.
Once it does, a second pass can backfill those fields using the same
league_average + off_rating - def_rating formula used in prior seasons
-- this script does not need to change for that, only a new step added
after it.
 
home_away is also left null on every game: the source file carries no
home/away indicator, so this can't be determined from what's available.
The front-end already tolerates a null/missing home_away (falls back to
"at" instead of alternating "vs"/"at"); revisit if home/away ever gets
added to the source data.
